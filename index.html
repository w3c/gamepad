        The Gamepad specification defines a low-level interface that represents
        gamepad devices.

      <h2>
        Introduction
      </h2>
      <p>
        Some [=user agent=]s have connected gamepad devices. These devices are
        desirable and suited to input for gaming applications, and for "10
        foot" user interfaces (presentations, media viewers).
      </p>
      <p>
        Currently, the only way for a gamepad to be used as input would be to
        emulate mouse or keyboard events, however this would lose information
        and require additional software outside of the [=user agent=] to
        accomplish emulation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Meanwhile, native applications are capable of accessing these devices
        via system APIs.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Gamepad API provides a solution to this problem by specifying
        interfaces that allow web applications to directly act on gamepad data.
      </p>

      <h2>
        Scope
      </h2>
      <p>
        Interfacing with external devices designed to control games has the
        potential to become large and intractable if approached in full
        generality. In this specification we explicitly choose to narrow scope
        to provide a useful subset of functionality that can be widely
        implemented and broadly useful.
      </p>
      <p>
        Specifically, we choose to only support the functionality required to
        support gamepads. Support for gamepads requires two input types:
        buttons and axes. Both buttons and axes are reported as analog values,
        buttons ranging from [0..1], and axes ranging from [-1..1].
      </p>
      <p>
        While the primary goal is support for gamepad devices, supporting these
        two types of analog inputs allows support for other similar devices
        common to current gaming systems including joysticks, driving wheels,
        pedals, and accelerometers. As such, the name "gamepad" is exemplary
        rather than trying to be a generic name for the entire set of devices
        addressed by this specification.
      </p>
      <p>
        We specifically exclude support for more complex devices that may also
        be used in some gaming contexts, including those that that do motion
        sensing, depth sensing, video analysis, gesture recognition, and so on.

            example, a USB gamepad may be identified by its `idVendor` and
            `idProduct` values. Unique identifiers like serial numbers or
            Bluetooth device addresses MUST NOT be included in the

          disconnected, previously assigned indices MUST NOT be reassigned to
          gamepads that continue to be connected. However, if a gamepad is
          disconnected, and subsequently the same or a different gamepad is
          then connected, the lowest previously used index MUST be reused.

          displacement from neutral is greater than a threshold chosen by the
          [=user agent=], and the axis has reported a value below the threshold

          (for example, an axis for a joystick that does not self-center), or
          an axis has never reported a value below the axis gesture threshold,
          then the axis SHOULD NOT be considered when checking for interaction.
          The axis gesture threshold SHOULD be large enough that random jitter
          is not considered interaction.

      </h2>
      <p>
        Each device manufacturer creates many different products and each has
        unique styles and layouts of buttons and axes. It is intended that the
        [=user agent=] support as many of these as possible.
      </p>
      <p>
        Additionally there are <em>de facto</em> standard layouts that have
        been made popular by game consoles. When the [=user agent=] recognizes
        the attached device, it is RECOMMENDED that it be remapped to a
        canonical ordering when possible. Devices that are not recognized
        should still be exposed in their raw form.
      </p>
      <p data-link-for="Gamepad">
        There is currently one canonical layout, the <dfn>Standard
        Gamepad</dfn>. When remapping, the indices in {{Gamepad/axes}} and
        {{Gamepad/buttons}} should correspond as closely as possible to the
        physical locations in the diagram below. Additionally,
        {{Gamepad/mapping}} SHOULD be set to {{GamepadMappingType/"standard"}}.
      </p>
      <p>
        The [=Standard Gamepad=] buttons are laid out in a left cluster of four
        buttons, a right cluster of four buttons, a center cluster of three
        buttons, and a pair of front facing buttons on the left and right side
        of the gamepad. The four axes of the "Standard Gamepad" are associated
        with a pair of analog sticks, one on the left and one on the right. The
        following table describes the buttons/axes and their physical
        locations.
      </p>
      <p>
        An axis input <dfn>represents a Standard Gamepad axis</dfn> if it
        reports the input value for a thumbstick axis, the thumbstick is
        located in approximately the same location as the corresponding
        [=Standard Gamepad=] thumbstick, and the orientation of the axis
        (up-down or left-right) matches the orientation of the [=Standard
        Gamepad=] axis. If there are multiple axes that represent the same
        [=Standard Gamepad=] axis, then the [=user agent=] SHOULD select one to
        be the [=Standard Gamepad=] axis and assign a different index to the
        other axis.
      </p>
      <p>
        A button input <dfn>represents a Standard Gamepad button</dfn> if it
        reports the input value for a button or trigger, and the button or
        trigger is located in approximately the same location as the
        corresponding [=Standard Gamepad=] button.
      </p>
      <p>
        If an axis or button input represents a [=Standard Gamepad=] axis or
        button, then its <dfn>canonical index</dfn> is the index of the
        corresponding [=Standard Gamepad=] axis or button.

        Usage Examples
      </h2>
      <p>
        The example below demonstrates typical access to gamepads. Note the
        relationship with the
        {{AnimationFrameProvider/requestAnimationFrame()}} method.
      </p>
      <pre class="example js">
        function runAnimation() {
            window.requestAnimationFrame(runAnimation);
            for (const pad of navigator.getGamepads()) {
              // todo; simple demo of displaying pad.axes and pad.buttons
              console.log(pad);
            }
        }

        window.requestAnimationFrame(runAnimation);
      </pre>
      <div class="practice">
        <span id="practice-timing" class="practicelab">Coordination with
        <code>requestAnimationFrame()</code></span>
        <p class="practicedesc">
          Interactive applications will typically be using the
          {{AnimationFrameProvider/requestAnimationFrame()}} method to drive
          animation, and will want coordinate animation with user gamepad
          input. As such, the gamepad data should be polled as closely as
          possible to immediately before the animation callbacks are executed,
          and with frequency matching that of the animation. That is, if the
          animation callbacks are running at 60Hz, the gamepad inputs should
          also be sampled at that rate.
