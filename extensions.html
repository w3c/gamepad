      <h2>
        Introduction
      </h2>
      <p>
        The Gamepad API provides a tightly scoped interface to gamepad devices
        and is focused on the most common elements of those devices, namely
        axis and button inputs. It specifically excludes support for more
        complex devices (e.g., those that do motion tracking or haptic
        feedback).
      </p>
      <p>
        However, some uses of gamepads (e.g., those paired with Virtual Reality
        headsets) rely heavily on those more advanced features. This
        supplemetary spec describes extensions to the base API to accommodate
        those use cases. If they prove to be broadly useful, the hope is that
        they will be eventually merged into the <a href="./">main spec</a>.
