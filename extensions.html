      <h2>Introduction</h2>

      <p>The Gamepad API provides a tightly scoped interface to gamepad devices
      and is focused on the most common elements of those devices, namely axis
      and button inputs. It specifically excludes support for more complex
      devices (e.g., those that do motion tracking or haptic feedback).</p>

      <p>However, some uses of gamepads (e.g., those paired with Virtual
      Reality headsets) rely heavily on those more advanced features. This
      supplemetary spec describes extensions to the base API to accommodate
      those use cases. If they prove to be broadly useful, the hope is that
      they will be eventually merged into the <a href="./">main spec</a>.</p>

      <h2><dfn>GamepadHand</dfn> Enum</h2>

          The empty string indicates the hand that is holding the gamepad is

          two hands).
        </dd>

      <h2><dfn>GamepadHapticActuator</dfn> Interface</h2>
      <p>
        Each <code>GamepadHapticActuator</code> corresponds to a motor or other
        actuator that can apply a force for the purposes of haptic feedback.
      </p>

      <pre class="idl">

            <var>duration</var> milliseconds. The value passed to
            <code>pulse()</code> is clamped to limits defined by the actuator
            type. The returned Promise will resolve <code>true</code> once the
            pulse has completed.
          </p>

            Repeated calls to <code>pulse()</code> override the previous

        <dt><dfn>vibration</dfn></dt>
        <dd>
          Vibration is a rumbling effect often implemented as an offset weight
          driven on a rotational axis. The <code>value</code> of a vibration
          force determines the frequency of the rumble effect and is
          normalized between <code>0.0</code> and <code>1.0</code>. The

        <dd>
          Orientation of the gamepad as a quaternion. An orientation of
          <code>[0, 0, 0, 1]</code> is considered to be <code>forward</code>.
          The forward direction MUST be determined by the gamepad hardware. The
          forward direction MAY be the orientation of the hardware when it was
          first polled if no other reference orientation is available. If the
          sensor is incapable of providing orientation data, the orientation
          MUST be <code>null</code>. When not <code>null</code>, the
