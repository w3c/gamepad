      The Gamepad specification defines a low-level interface that represents
      gamepad devices.
    </section>

    <section id='introduction' class='informative'>

      <h2>Introduction</h2>

      <p>Some <a>user agent</a>s have connected gamepad devices. These devices
      are desirable and suited to input for gaming applications, and for
      &quot;10 foot&quot; user interfaces (presentations, media viewers).</p>

      <p>Currently, the only way for a gamepad to be used as input would be
      to emulate mouse or keyboard events, however this would lose information
      and require additional software outside of the <a>user agent</a> to
      accomplish emulation.</p>

      <p>Meanwhile, native applications are capable of accessing these devices
      via system APIs.</p>

      <p>The Gamepad API provides a solution to this problem by specifying
      interfaces that allow web applications to directly act on gamepad
      data.</p>

      <p>This specification references interfaces from a number of other
      specifications:</p>

      <ul>
      <li><a class="externalDFN">Navigator</a> [[!NAVIGATOR]]</li>
      <li><a class="externalDFN">DOMHighResTimeStamp</a> [[!HRTIME]]</li>
      <li><a class="externalDFN">WindowAnimationTiming</a></li>
      </ul>

    </section>

    <section id='conformance'>
      <p>
        This specification defines conformance criteria that apply to a single
        product: the <dfn id="dfn-user-agent">user agent</dfn> that implements
        the interfaces that it contains.
      </p>

      <p>
        Implementations that use ECMAScript to implement the APIs defined in
        this specification MUST implement them in a manner consistent with the
        ECMAScript Bindings defined in the Web IDL specification [[!WEBIDL]] as
        this specification uses that specification and terminology.
      </p>

      <p>
        A conforming implementation is required to implement all fields
        defined in this specification.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>

      <h2>Scope</h2>

      <p>Interfacing with external devices designed to control games has the
      potential to become large and intractable if approached in full
      generality. In this specification we explicitly choose to narrow scope
      to provide a useful subset of functionality that can be widely
      implemented and broadly useful.</p>

      <p>Specifically, we choose to only support the functionality required to
      support gamepads. Support for gamepads requires two input types: buttons
      and axes. Both buttons and axes are reported as analog values, buttons
      ranging from [0..1], and axes ranging from [-1..1].</p>

      <p>While the primary goal is support for gamepad devices, supporting
      these two types of analog inputs allows support for other similar devices
      common to current gaming systems including joysticks, driving wheels,
      pedals, and accelerometers. As such, the name "gamepad" is exemplary
      rather than trying to be a generic name for the entire set of devices
      addressed by this specification.</p>

      <p>We specifically exclude support for more complex devices that may also
      be used in some gaming contexts, including those that that do motion
      sensing, depth sensing, video analysis, gesture recognition, and so
      on.</p>

    <section>
      <h2><a>Gamepad</a> Interface</h2>
      <p>
        This interface defines an individual gamepad device.
      </p>

      <dl title='interface Gamepad' class='idl'>

        <dt>readonly attribute DOMString id</dt>
        <dd>
          An identification string for the gamepad.

          This string identifies the brand or style of connected gamepad
          device. Typically, this will include the USB vendor and a product
          ID.
        </dd>

        <dt>readonly attribute long index</dt>
        <dd>
          The index of the gamepad in the <a>Navigator</a>.

          When multiple gamepads are connected to a <a>user agent</a>,
          indices MUST be assigned on a first-come, first-serve basis,
          starting at zero. If a gamepad is disconnected, previously assigned
          indices MUST NOT be reassigned to gamepads that continue to be
          connected. However, if a gamepad is disconnected, and subsequently
          the same or a different gamepad is then connected, index entries
          MUST be reused.

        </dd>

        <dt>readonly attribute DOMHighResTimeStamp timestamp</dt>

        <dd>
          Last time the data for this gamepad was updated.

          Timestamp is a monotonically increasing value that allows the author
          to determine if the <code>axes</code> and <code>button</code> data
          have been updated from the hardware, relative to a previously saved
          timestamp. The time is relative to the navigationStart of attribute
          of the PerformanceTiming interface (that is, fractional milliseconds
          since page load).

        </dd>

        <dt>readonly attribute double[] axes</dt>
        <dd>

          Array of values for all axes of the gamepad.

          All axis values MUST be linearly normalized to the range [-1.0 ..
          1.0]. As appropriate, -1.0 SHOULD correspond to "up" or "left", and
          1.0 SHOULD correspond to "down" or "right".

          Axes that are drawn from a 2D input device SHOULD appear next to
          each other in the axes array, X then Y.

          It is RECOMMENDED that axes appear in decreasing order of
          importance, such that element 0 and 1 typically represent the X and
          Y axis of a directional stick.

        </dd>

        <dt>readonly attribute double[] buttons</dt>
        <dd>
          Array of values for all buttons of the gamepad.

          All button values MUST be linearly normalized to the range [0.0 ..
          1.0]. 0.0 MUST mean fully unpressed, and 1.0 MUST mean fully
          pressed.

          It is RECOMMENDED that buttons appear in decreasing importance such
          that the primary button, secondary button, tertiary button, and so
          on appear as elements 0, 1, 2, ... in the buttons array.

        </dd>

      <h2><a>Navigator</a> Interface extension</h2>

      <p>

        This partial interface defines an extension to the <a>Navigator</a>
        interface.

      </p>


      <dl title='partial interface Navigator' class='idl'>
        <dt>Gamepad[] getGamepads()</dt>

        <dd>

          Retrieve a snapshot of the data for the the currently connected and
          interacted-with gamepads.

          Gamepads MUST only appear in the list if they are currently
          connected to the <a>user agent</a>, and at least one device has been
          interacted with by the user. If no devices have been interacted
          with, devices MUST NOT appear in the list to avoid a malicious page
          from fingerprinting the user.

        </dd>

      </dl>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2><a>GamepadEvent</a> Interface</h2>

      <dl title='interface GamepadEvent : Event' class='idl'>
        <dt>readonly attribute Gamepad gamepad</dt>

        <dd>

            The single gamepad attribute provides access to the associated
            gamepad data for this event.

        <h2>Usage Examples</h2>

          <p>

            The example below demonstrates typical access to gamepads. Note
            the relationship with the <a>WindowAnimationTiming</a>
            interface.
          </p>

          <section>
              <pre class="example">

function runAnimation()
{
    window.requestAnimationFrame(runAnimation);

    for (var i = 0; i < navigator.gamepads.length; ++i)
    {
        var pad = navigator.gamepads[i];
        // todo; simple demo of displaying pad.axes and pad.buttons
    }
}

window.requestAnimationFrame(runAnimation);

              </pre>
          </section>

          <div class="practice"> 
              <p> 
              <span id="practice-timing" class="practicelab">Coordination with
              WindowAnimationTiming</span></p> 
              <p class="practicedesc"> 

              Interactive applications will typically be using the
              <a>WindowAnimationTiming</a> interface to drive animation, and
              will want coordinate animation with user gamepad input. As
              such, the gamepad data should be polled as closely as possible
              to immediately before the animation callbacks are executed, and
              with frequency matching that of the animation. That is, if the
              animation callbacks are running at 60Hz, the gamepad inputs
              should also be sampled at that rate.

              </p> 
          </div>

    <section>

      <h3 id="event-gamepadconnected">The <dfn class="event">gamepadconnected</dfn> event</h3>

        <p>

          A <a>user agent</a> MUST dispatch this event type to indicate the
          user has connected a gamepad. If a gamepad was already connected
          when the page was loaded, the <a>gamepadconnected</a> event will be
          dispatched when the user presses a button or moves an axis.

        </p>

    </section>

    <section>

        <h3 id="event-gamepaddisconnected">The <dfn class="event">gamepaddisconnected</dfn> event</h3>

        <p>

          When a gamepad is disconnected from the <a>user agent</a>, if the
          <a>user agent</a> has previously dispatched a
          <a>gamepadconnected</a> event, a <a>gamepaddisconnected</a> event
          MUST be dispatched.

        </p>

    </section>

    <section>

        <h3>Other events</h3>

        <p>

        <i>More discussion needed, on whether to include or exclude axis and button
        changed events, and whether to roll them more together
        (<code>gamepadchanged</code>?), separate somewhat
        (<code>gamepadaxischanged</code>?), or separate by individual axis
        and button.</i>
